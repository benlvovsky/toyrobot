# This is a Toy Robot test exercise in C++
I used Eclipse as IDE, homebrew gtest (with gmock) install C++ 11
It has 2 projects:
1. Is the Toy Robot Project 
2. Test project I used to develop and test the above

The dev was via TDD and may have some remnants form that process like some extra unneeded anymore at the end tests

# To run test: `unit_test/Debug/unit_test`
# To run the program itself: ``
## in interative mode: from `ToyRobot/Debug` folder `./ToyRobot`
## with baqtch resource file: `cat ../resources/testrun.txt  | ./ToyRobot`
